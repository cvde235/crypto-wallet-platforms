## **FAQ**

**How do I choose between hot and cold wallet storage?**

Consider transaction frequency and security needs. Hot wallets excel for active trading, DeFi participation, and regular transactions—keeping assets accessible on internet-connected devices. Cold wallets prioritize maximum security by isolating private keys offline, ideal for long-term holdings or large amounts you won't touch frequently. Many users employ both: cold storage for savings, hot wallets for spending.

**What makes multi-chain support important in 2025?**

Cryptocurrency ecosystems fragment across specialized blockchains—Ethereum for DeFi, Solana for speed, Bitcoin for value storage. Multi-chain wallets eliminate the need for separate interfaces, letting you manage diverse holdings through one application. This matters increasingly as assets bridge between networks and protocols deploy across chains. Single-chain wallets force app-switching overhead while multi-chain solutions streamline portfolio management.

**Can I recover my wallet if I lose access to my device?**

Recovery depends on backup methods. Traditional wallets use 12-24 word seed phrases that restore full access on any compatible wallet application—lose the device, keep the phrase, regain your crypto. Seedless wallets like Zengo use alternative recovery through biometric verification and encrypted files. Hardware wallets with backup cards, like Tangem, restore from duplicate cards rather than seed phrases. Always understand your specific wallet's recovery system before storing significant amounts.
